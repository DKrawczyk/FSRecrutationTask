# RecrutationTask

### Installation
This recruitment task uses [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). To run this project on your computer, you should install all dependencies. Then create a localhost porst and run your web explorer.

Move to the app main workspace and run:

    npm i

This should install all necessary packages.
Now it's time to run your local API. You need to run:

    json-server --watch ./database/data.json --port 3000

To create a localhost port you should type:

    npm start

After this, all datas would be available at port 3000

    http://localhost:3000/

Now enjoy :).

I didn't add hooks, because I'm just learning about them. After one week I should have enough knowledge to make this good enough.
